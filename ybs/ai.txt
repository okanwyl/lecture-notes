A decision model is an idealized representation of the problem

# it is a top down model like a triangle
# strategy -> decision neural network tactis -> operations -> company

#expert system

expert knows symbloic numeric knowledge and those informations build knowledge base
this knowledge base has rules
and than those information used by non-expert to make an expert decision



#expert system 2
Architecture of the expert system

non expert user -> <- user interface -> <- inference engine -> <- knowledge base -> <- knowledge acqusition engine <- expert

also inference has a connection to the explenation module


difference of decision support system and expert system

dss goal is help user make a decision
es goal is a provide expert advice

dss method is data-model-presentation
expert method is ask questions, applies rules, explains

dss type of problems general limited by user models
es type of problems narrow domain


ES Example system daily usage

CaDet -> Cancer decision support tool
DENDRAL -> helps chemists identify unknown organic molecules
DXplain -> is a clinical support system that diagnoses various diseases
MYCIN -> identifies bacteria such as bacterima and meningitis
PXDES -> determines the type and severiy of a lung cancer
R1/XCON -> expert system for building computer based on customer specifications

ES Problem Suitability

Narrow well defined domain
solutions that require an expert decision
complex logical processing needs some inference
handle and data missing, ill-structured data(bad thing)
need cooperative expert
repeatable decision



ES Development
// Expert and knowledge engineer builds knowledge base and programmer builds custom program in LISP
// Designer design decision trees, forward and backward chaining
// custom program and shells connected to the knowledge base
// ES screens seen by user

ES shells(command line tooling)
custom programing (lisp, prolog)



Limitations of the ES
fragile systems (kirilgan)
mistakes and accidents who is responsible?
vague rules(belirsiz degerler)
conflciting experts
unforeseen events


Knowledge Management
a collection of documents and data
- experts
- highly organized groupware
- vurgulayan context
example: business decisions

neural network -> positive nodes exicitatory connection, negative value means inhibitory connectionos
if you sum all that that means linear combination
activation function controls the amplitude of the output


fuzzy logic example -> is it cold 0.9 very much, litte 0.25 , very less 0.1


example extended version of the loan system 
AI -> Deterime rules, neural network weights, evaluate new data and make recommendation


example of the email categorization -> steps to set rules
define conditions -> take actions -> define exceptions


strategic analysis -> common factors

- competition is main factor for strategic analysis
- suppliers and customers should be maintained
- be best firm
- block competitor by make happy customers



strategy formulation -> 

1. situtation analysis : self-evaluation and competitor analysis, both internal and external, micro and macro
2. objectives are set via situtation analysis 
2.a vision
2.b mission (society)
2.c corporate 
2.d unit(financial and strategic)

those objectives should suggest a strategic plan


strategy implementation

- allocation of resources
- establish chain of command
- assign tasks 
- manage processes and monitor results
- acquire necessary resources



michael porter's five forces model


main component: rivalry among existing competitors
others: suppliers, threat of substiute products services, power of buyers, threat of new entrants



value chain: value adding activies
ex: primary-> inbound logistics, operations
support activities -> administrative infrastructure management
costs and value drivers are value activity
ultimate goal maximize value creation while minimizing costs



forms of electronic commerce

B2B -> EDI, commodity auctions, EDI: Electronci data interchange: computer to computer exchange of business documents
B2C -> sales support
C2B -> minimal exmaples possibly reverse auctions like priceline
C2C -> auctoion sites ex: ebay


possible answers of questions

1.	Stratejik karar formülasyonunun 3 adımını açıklayınız / Explain 3 steps of strategy formulation?

maybe this -> strategy formulation, strategy implementation, strategy evaluation

or this -> 
first step do a situtation analysis that includes self-evaluation competitor analysis, both internal and external
micro and macro
second step is gathered information lights the objectives
- Objective statements
1.vision statements
2. missions statements(society)
3. coorparate objectives (financial and strategic)
4. unit objectives (financial and strategic)
third step is those objectives lights strategic plan


2. EDI -> Electronic data interchange is the concept of businesses electronically communicating information that was traditionally communicated on paper, such as purchase orders, advance ship notices, and invoices.  B2B

3. Compare Expert System with Decision Support System in terms of goal, method and type of problems that can be applied
Ans: 

dss goal is help user make a decision
es goal is a provide expert advice

dss method is data-model-presentation
expert method is ask questions, applies rules, explains

dss type of problems general limited by user models
es type of problems narrow domain

4. Design a decisino tree ex decisino tree is person fit

5. Explain 5 steps of strategy implementation

strategy implementation

- allocation of resources
- establish chain of command
- assign tasks 
- manage processes and monitor results
- acquire necessary resources

6. ?
