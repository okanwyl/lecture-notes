Embedded system tanim?:
Embedded systems are information processing systems embedded into a larger product
in the slides
Application specific computer system
built into larger systems
often with realtime computing constratins
---
---
---
Why add a computer to larger system?
better perf, more func, lower cost for automation, more dependability

Cyber-Physical Systems and Embedded systems
CPS = ES + Physical env  -> trcesi : integration of computations + networking + physical processlerin butunu

Emerging CPS will be coordinated, disturbted, connnected olmasi gerekiyor ->  
CONNNECTED = internet uzerinden erisilebilir olmasi
DISTURBTED = Also known as disturbted computing and disturbted databases a collection of 
independent components located on different machines that share messages with each other in order to achieve common goals.
COORDINATED = you know that

examples -> smart transportations, smart buildings, next-gen air traffic etc..

 Ubiquitous computing => her yerde bulunan computing?
from wiki: where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. 
In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format. 
example -> laptop tablets notebooks smartphones you got the idea

Microprocesscor (CPU)
as a single processor core that supports at least instruction fetching, decoding, and executing. 
important -L> Instruction fetching, decoding, executing must
contains Memory interface, Register banks

Instruction cycle -> meaning fetch-decode-execute
modern cpus execution cycle is concurrent and parallel

Instruction decoder -> The instruction decoder logic converts the op-code bits into settings for all the internal control lines. The operand provides a literal, file register address or program address, which will be used by the instruction.

from wiki - multipurpose , clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit 
takes input binary output binary
---

---
MCU Microcontroller
VLSI -> Very Large Scale Integration mil-bil MOS transistor to one single chip

single processor core
memory block, digitial io, analog io
generally used for basic control
contains one system bus
we can think that as a SoC

What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, 
software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

problems: 
scalibility -> huge amount of data
Interoperability -> doesn't include any standardatizion includes but not enought it is fragmanted
Lack of goverment support -> like FDA doesn't come up with standard commmitte
Safety op patients -> can be dangerous like wearable ones?
Security And Personal Privacy -> Security security vulnerabilities and its improvements.
Design based constraints -> limited computataion power, limited energy, limited memory
always on causes increased connectivity-> artan network ihtiyaci
demographic -> what? yozlasma mi

IoT cihazlarini 4 gruba ayiralim ->  mobile, embedded, networking, connected community


Why Iot -> Items can have more functionalites and become more intelligent
items can be managed in easier way?
more information becoma will available

Load Store architecture
that divides instructions into two categories: memory access (load and store between memory and registers) 
and ALU operations (which only occur between registers)
---
---
---
RISC 
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) vs Complex Instruction Set Computing? computer (CISC)
RISC probably need more instruction to set accompclish same exact result
RISC generally load/store model -> 16-32 bit high speed general purpose registers
---
---
---
ARM Family 
ARM chips are cheap to produce
extremly power efficent
sells license -> not manufactaring chips
Cortex-A -> High Performance
Cortex-P -> Fast Response --> doesn't include on slides
Cortex-M -> Low power
SecurCore -> Tamper resistant guess it magneticlly resistant?
---
---
---
Cortex-A  Family
Highest Performance
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
32bit-64bit and 16bit/32-bit instruction sets
application processors 3rd party applications
telefonda direkt core

Cortex-R Family
embedded real time processing
signal processing, control applications
telefonda anten wifi 

Cortex-M Family
Microcontroller oriented processors for MCU,
ASSP(Application Specific System Processor)
SoC applications
telefonda flashi kontrol eden Microcontroller, touchscreen controller, power mgmnt, sensor hub
genelde bluetoothdada kullanilir
---
---
---
Armv7-A and Armv8-A architecture (Armv7 32bit instruction set, mobile devices
armv8 64bit instruction set focus on power efficent)
backward compatible
full os sport

Thumb2 vs Thumb
thumb normalde 32 bit olan instruction sette 2^^32 den 2 milyar komut var
toplasan 22bin kullaniriz 16bitlik olan instructionlarda kullanilsin
alandan tasarruf yapalim demisler ikisini birlikte kullanan thumb2
thumb2 ve thumb arasinda gecis yapabiliyor cortex a
thumb ise sike sike kullaniliyor cortex m de
