Two distinct goal:
1. To demonstrate to the developer and the customer that software meets requirements
2.To discover situations in which the behavior of the software is incorrect, undesirable, 
or does not conform its specification


# Validation Testing
Static practice verifying the specific requiremnets
expected usage of system

# Defect testing
expose defects


testing cna only show the presence of errors, not their obsence

verification and validaton ultimae goal is establish confidence that software system
is fit for purpose


required confidence depends on the system's purpose

1. Software purpose: more critical needs more confidence
2. user exceptations : first init maybe low but customer will be expect more quality in future
3. Marketing enviorment: ? wtf



verification is static
validation is dynamic


three stages of testing:
1. development testing
2. release testing
3. user testing

# Development testing
might be include static code analysis, data flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews,
unit testing, code covarge analysis, tracebility,
static code analysis -> debugging with eyes and needs project structure
data flow analysis -> programs control flow graph used to determine those parts of a programs
to which particular value assigned to a variable might propagate used by compilers
peer code reviews -> developers analyze teammate code
