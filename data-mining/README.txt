## Start of CHAPTER 1
# What is data mining?

- Simply stated, data mining refers to extracting or "mining" knowledge from large amounts of data (sand gold relation)
- Knowledge Discovery From Data, KDD synonym for data mining 
- Knowledge discovery process iterative sequence
1. Data Cleaning ( to remove noise and inconsistent data)
2. Data Integration (where multiple data sources may be combined)
3. Data selection (where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from database)
4. Data transformation (where data are transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations, for instance)
5. Data Mining (an essential process where intelligent methods are applied in order to extract data patterns)
6. Pattern evaluation (identify truly interesting patterns)
7. Knowledge presentation (visualize)

- 1 to 4 is different forms of data preprocessing
- Standart architecture of typical data mining system consist components are
1. database
2. data warehouse
3. world wide web
4. other info repos
5. database
6. data mining engine
7. pattern evaluation
8. user interface
9. knowledege base

# Data Warehouses (work on that?) @TODO
-OLAP qubic (drill up drill down @TODO)
ex: 
-> vancouver, attributes address:toronto, new york, chigaco (top face)
-> front face attributes time(quarter): q1,q2,q3,q4

# Transactional Databases
- each transaction added to the database


# Object-relational Databases
- object oriented wrapper you know that

# Temporal Databases, Sequence Databases, and Time-Series Databases
- Temporal database stores relational data that include time-releated attributes
- Sequence Database stores sequence of ordered events
- Time-series Databases stores sequences of values or events obtained over repeated measurements of time(hours,daily,weekly)


# Spatial Databases and Spatiotemperal Databases
- Spatial database contain spatial(uzamsal)-related information such as maps geography
- Spatial data may be presented as a raster format(just a image format like png jpg but in a matrix)
- Spatiotemperal databases are same but changes in time

# Text databases and Multimedia Databases
- Text Databases are stores Long sequence of words.
- Multimedia databases you know that 

# Heterogeneous Databases and Legacy Databases
- Heterogeneous database consists a  set of interconnected, autonommous component databases.
- That's legacy?

# Data Streams
- Where data flow in and out of an observation platform or window dynamically.
- Huge or possibly infinite volume, dynamically changing, flowing in and out in a fixed order
- Often real time
-   

# Data Mining Functionalities
- Data mining tasks can be classified into two catagorioes : descriptive, predictive


# Concept/Class Description : Characterization and Discrimination

- Data characterization is a summarization of the general charecteristics or features of a target class of data.
Ex: To study the characteristics of a software products whose sales increased by a %10 in the last year, data can be
collected by SQL query
