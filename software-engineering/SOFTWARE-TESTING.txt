program testing : testing with artifitical data

can reveal the presence of errors not their absence

testing is a more general v&v which also includes static validation techniques

static techniques example-> handmade reviews generally early stage
dynamic testing -> funcitonal, non-functionaL-> unit testing integration testing system testing etc. 
later stage


program testing goals


diffrences of validation testing and defect testing

validaton testing purpose -> requirement analysis results should be tested
if the software is generic all over of the system should be tested

defect testing purpose -> which behavior is incorrect

goals of validation testing and defect testing

validation test -> a successful test shows that the system operates as intended

defect test -> a successful test makes the system perform incorrectly so that exposes a defect in the
system


verification and validation

verification -> are we building product right?
validation -> are we building right product?

aim of the v&v establish confidence that the system is 'fit for purpose'
diffrences of purposes
1. software purpose -> level of confidence depends on organization
2. user expectations -> users may have low expectations of certain kind of software
3. marketing enviorment -> market early maybe exposes defects.

#verification techniques -> peer reviews, walkthrough, inspections really?



inspections 

inspections and testing are complementary and not opposing verification techniques
both shoudl be used V&V

software inspections : analysis of the static system representation of discover problems maybe tool based
# Maybe this called as static verification
# static verification -> bad patterns exmp nullability, code conventions
needs people examples -> requirements design, configuration data, test data





advantages: 
1. errors can mask other errors so don't need to be concerned with interactions betweeen 
errors
2. incomplete parts of a system can be inspected without additional cost
# 3. WTF? As well as searching for program defects, an inspection can also consider broader quality attributes 
of a program, such as compliance with standards, portability and maintainability.
