Embedded system tanim?:
Embedded systems are information processing systems embedded into a larger product
in the slides
Application specific computer system
built into larger systems
often with realtime computing constratins
---

---
Why add a computer to larger system?
better perf, more func, lower cost for automation, more dependability

Cyber-Physical Systems and Embedded systems
CPS = ES + Physical env  -> trcesi : integration of computations + networking + physical processlerin butunu

Emerging CPS will be coordinated, disturbted, connnected olmasi gerekiyor ->  
CONNNECTED = internet uzerinden erisilebilir olmasi
DISTURBTED = Also known as disturbted computing and disturbted databases a collection of 
independent components located on different machines that share messages with each other in order to achieve common goals.
COORDINATED = you know that

examples -> smart transportations, smart buildings, next-gen air traffic etc..

 Ubiquitous computing => her yerde bulunan computing?
from wiki: where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. 
In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format. 
example -> laptop tablets notebooks smartphones you got the idea

Microprocesscor (CPU)
as a single processor core that supports at least instruction fetching, decoding, and executing. 
important -L> Instruction fetching, decoding, executing must
contains Memory interface, Register banks

Instruction cycle -> meaning fetch-decode-execute
modern cpus execution cycle is concurrent and parallel

Instruction decoder -> The instruction decoder logic converts the op-code bits into settings for all the internal control lines. The operand provides a literal, file register address or program address, which will be used by the instruction.

from wiki - multipurpose , clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit 
takes input binary output binary

MCU Microcontroller
VLSI -> Very Large Scale Integration mil-bil MOS transistor to one single chip

single processor core
memory block, digitial io, analog io
generally used for basic control
contains one system bus
we can think that as a SoC

What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, 
software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

problems: 
scalibility -> huge amount of data
Interoperability -> doesn't include any standardatizion includes but not enought it is fragmanted
Lack of goverment support -> like FDA doesn't come up with standard commmitte
Safety op patients -> can be dangerous like wearable ones?
Security And Personal Privacy -> Security security vulnerabilities and its improvements.
Design based constraints -> limited computataion power, limited energy, limited memory
always on causes increased connectivity-> artan network ihtiyaci
demographic -> what? yozlasma mi

IoT cihazlarini 4 gruba ayiralim ->  mobile, embedded, networking, connected community


Why Iot -> Items can have more functionalites and become more intelligent
items can be managed in easier way?
more information becoma will available
