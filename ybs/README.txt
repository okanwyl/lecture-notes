***CH1 classifcation of the information systems***

What is Management Information Systems?
combination of procedures, people, and computer technology that is used to provide information
to help making decisions and managing a firm
Academic discipline covering these People, Procedures, Technologies collectively
MIS purpose is to help all levels of management making their information based decisions
with various type of tools


Decision-making choosing alternatives based on the values, preferences, and beliefs of decision-maker

Decision making processes
1. Identify problem
2. Collect information
3. Identify the alternatives
4. Weigh the evidence
5. Choose from the alternatives
6. Implement the action
7. Evaluate results go to step 2

Information systems primary purpose
IS collects data, processes it into information then
converts information into knowledge for a specific purpose

There is a graph also knowledge grasps reasons and that becomesa understanding
understanding grasps principles and becomes wisdom

Data:
- Elementary description of things, events, activities and transactions that are recorded, classified
and stored but not organized to convey any specific meaning

Information:
- Data organized and they have meaning and value to the recipient
- Data that has been put into a meaningful and useful context

Knowledge
- Information that has been organized and processed to convey understandings, experience
and expertise as they can be applied to a current problem or activity

Wisdom
- The knowledge and experience needed to make sensible decisions and judgements or the good sense
shown by the decisions and judgements made acculamated knowledge of life in a particular sphere
of activity that has been gained through experience - for future use


Information Pyramid for those titles
Wisdom (Future)
Ex: stop car

Knowledge (Past)
Ex: the traffic light i am driving towards has turned red

Information (Past)
Ex: South facing traffic light on corner of pitt and george
streets has turned red

Data (Past)
red

Benefits of IS & MIS

- Supports core competency(yetkinlik)
- Enhances distribution channel management
- Increases production processes
- Allows a company flexibiliy in its output level
- Expanded E-Businnes
- Forces stability
- Improved B2B business

What is E-Businnes

B2C : Selling retail and end-products to consumers with tag prices
B2B : Selling at the wholesale level to other businesses price is negotiated
E-Businness : Using internet technologies to conduct any level of business

What do management do?
Decisions, organizing, planning, control, bugdeting, interpersonal relations, information flow,

Levels of Managerial Decision Making
***This is a pyramid***

Strategic management (unstructured): Executives and directors
Tactical  management (Semistructured): Businnes unit managers and self directed teams
Operational  management (Structured): Operating managers

***This is a table***

HEADERS
Decision level | Description | Example | Type of information

Strategic(Policy) | competetive advantage, restructuring, high cost, long term | new product will change the sector
| external events, rivals, sales, costs, quality, trends



Tactical(management) | improving operations without restructuring the company, low cost, mid term | new tools/software to cut costs or improve efficiency
| expenses schedules, sales, models, forecasts, production summary


Operations(execution) | Day-to-day actions to keep company functioning, short-term, no dev cost| scheduling employess ordering supplies
| operational transactions

// @TODO don't forget to look up for example

Strategic Decisions & Organizations

Strengths
- Source of strength
- Value of strength
- How can it be developed?
- What could undermine it?
- Development costs
- Additional Benefits
(Opportunities)

Weaknesses
- Effect on company
- Possible solutions

Information Systems
An information system collects, processes, stores,
analyzes, and disseminates information for software
applications.

We can determine a categorization
- By organization 
1. Depertmental IS -> e.g Accounting software
2. Enterprise-Wide IS -> e.g E-mail system
3. Inter-Organizational IS -> e.g Supply chain management

Information systems connected by networks 

Classification by support function
Support Function
***THIS IS A PYRAMID***
Top managers (Executive Support System)
Middle managers (MIS, DSS, ISS) Management, Decision, Intelligent
Data workers (Knowledge management system, office automation system)
Operational managers (Transaction processing system)

Transaction processing system(TPS)
- TPS automatives routine and repetetive tasks critical operations
- Data collected from this operation supports MIS and DSS employed by Middle Management
- Primary purpose perform transactions and collect data

Management information system(MIS)
organize and summarize, displays information supports
routine decision making in the functional areas

Decision support system(DSS)
support complex non-routine decisions,
primary purposes to process data into information
dss generally employed by tactical level management
what if data mining, queries 

Intelligent support system(ISS)
these systems perform intelligent problem solving(AI)


Executive Support/Information  system(EIS/ESS)
Executive or enterprise information system originally were implemented to support
senior management
supports strategic activities 


Office automation systems(OAS)
electronic communication systems email instant messaging, intranet portlas, word processing systems
spreadsheets, fax automation, document management systems


Knowledge managemenet systems(KMS)
financal and marketing analystts between top and middle management
finding or developing new knowledge
